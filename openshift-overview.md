## Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO)

The Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift service enables you to deploy fully managed OpenShift clusters.
Azure Red Hat OpenShift extends Kubernetes. Running containers in production with Kubernetes requires additional
tools and resources. This often includes needing to juggle image registries, storage management,
networking solutions, and logging and monitoring tools - all of which must be versioned and tested together.
Building container-based applications requires even more integration work with middleware, frameworks,
databases, and CI/CD tools. Azure Red Hat OpenShift combines all this into a single platform,
bringing ease of operations to IT teams while giving application teams what they need to execute.

Azure Red Hat OpenShift is jointly engineered, operated, and supported by Red Hat and Microsoft
to provide an integrated support experience.
